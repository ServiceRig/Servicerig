                                    <p>This application is a Next.js-based Field Service Management (FSM) platform called ServiceRig. It uses React with functional components and hooks, TypeScript for type safety, and ShadCN UI with Tailwind CSS for the user interface. Recent development has focused heavily on refining the core user experience of the scheduling module.</p>
                                    <p className="mt-2">For backend operations and data persistence, the app currently simulates a Firestore database using a mutable, in-memory object (`mockData`). All data fetching and mutation logic is centralized in files within `src/lib/firestore/` and exposed via Server Actions in `src/app/actions.ts`. This simulation is a major source of recurring issues but allows for rapid UI development.</p>

                                        <li><strong>Symptom:</strong> After dragging a job from the "To Be Scheduled" list and dropping it onto the calendar, the "ghost" preview would sometimes remain, the original item would not be removed from the list, or the drop would fail entirely.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Root Cause Analysis:</strong> The root cause was multifaceted, involving stale state in the `ToBeScheduledList` component and an incomplete data payload being passed by the `DraggableJob` component. The drop handler (`handleJobDrop`) would receive incorrect data, causing the state update to fail silently.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> The fix involved refactoring the `ToBeScheduledList` to receive its data via props rather than managing its own state, ensuring it always has the latest job list. Additionally, the `DraggableJob` component's `useDrag` hook was corrected to pass the complete `originalData` object in its payload, providing the drop handler with all necessary information to perform the update.</li>
