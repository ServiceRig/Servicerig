A significant amount of work went into refining this core user experience, resolving several data synchronization bugs, and iterating on the visual feedback to create an intuitive "ghosting" preview. The mock data architecture remains a potential source of issues, but the primary scheduling workflow is now stable.</p>

                                    <p className="text-muted-foreground">This application is a Next.js-based Field Service Management (FSM) platform called ServiceRig. It uses React with functional components and hooks, TypeScript for type safety, and ShadCN UI with Tailwind CSS for the user interface. Recent development has focused heavily on refining the core user experience of the scheduling module.</p>
                                    <p className="mt-2 text-muted-foreground">For backend operations and data persistence, the app currently simulates a Firestore database using a mutable, in-memory object (`mockData`). All data fetching and mutation logic is centralized in files within `src/lib/firestore/` and exposed via Server Actions in `src/app/actions.ts`. This simulation is a major source of recurring issues.</p>

                                     <p className="mt-2 text-blue-900/90">The latest cycle was dedicated to fixing a persistent and critical bug in the scheduling board's drag-and-drop functionality. We also refined the UI to be more intuitive.</p>

                                     <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-1 space-y-1">
                                        <li><strong>Symptom:</strong> After dragging a job from the "To Be Scheduled" list and dropping it onto the calendar, the "ghost" preview would remain, the original item would not be removed from the list, and the job's state was not updated in the backend.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Root Cause Analysis:</strong> Through console logs, we identified a `TypeError: can't access property "end", itemData is undefined`. This revealed that the `onDrop` event handler was receiving an incomplete data payload. The `originalData` object, which contained the full job details, was not being correctly packaged and passed by the `react-dnd` `useDrag` hook in our `DraggableJob` component.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> The fix involved modifying the `DraggableJob` component to ensure it consistently includes the `originalData` object within the item payload for the drag operation. Subsequently, the `handleJobDrop` function in the main scheduling page was updated to correctly access this data, preventing the runtime error and allowing the subsequent state updates (updating the job's schedule, clearing the ghost, and removing the job from the staged list) to execute successfully.</li>
                                     </ul>
                                     <h5 className="font-semibold mt-3">Evolving the Visual Feedback</h5>
                                      <p className="mt-1 text-blue-900/90">We iterated several times on the visual feedback for the user during a drag operation. Initial implementations of a thick border or simple highlighting were found to be either too distracting or not clear enough. We settled on the "ghosting" approach, where a semi-transparent preview of the job appears directly on the calendar grid, showing the user exactly where it will land. This provides the most intuitive and precise user experience.</p>
